.- CanvWrap -.
  CanvWrap is designed to mimic the DOM structure so that placing events on objects in the canvas
  is relatively simple.  Events may also be placed by using a method found in the wrapper to
  emulate the same behavior as if you were to place the event on the document, and then restrict it
  to the specified bounds to react.  
  
  TODO (Readme): add in further description, as well as examples of usage.
